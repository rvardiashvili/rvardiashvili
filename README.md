💻 About Me

I'm a final-year Computer Science student at Constructor University, Bremen, with a strong passion for building scalable backend systems and data-intensive applications. My experience spans enterprise integration with Java and optimizing large-scale data processing pipelines in Python.

🎓 Education: B.Sc. in Computer Science (expected 2026) from Constructor University.

🛠️ Currently Working On: Building robust solutions using Java Spring and exploring Docker for deployment.

⚙️ Core Focus: Cloud-native architecture, efficient data handling, and reliable API integration.

🚀 Key Projects & Experience

1. Backend Integration Solutions (Softgen)

Role: Backend Developer (Jul - Sep 2025)

Focus: Engineered and deployed Java-based integration solutions to automate complex interactions with the Georgian Revenue Service.

Impact: Streamlined data exchange for tax-related workflows, ensuring secure and reliable communication between internal systems and external services.

2. A Scalable Pipeline for Satellite Image Segmentation

Goal: Process gigapixel satellite images on standard hardware.

Technology: Python, PyTorch, Lightning, Rasterio, NumPy.

Innovation: Designed a model-agnostic, memory-efficient, chunk-based workflow. Achieved optimized performance using a multi-threaded producer-consumer architecture and developed a weighted-averaging algorithm for seamless prediction maps.

3. Millennium Innovation Award Finalist

Project: Built an assistive hardware system using Arduino and Visual Basic.

Features: Included medication reminders (voice/Braille), audio recognition alerts, and music-to-vibration conversion.
